Galaxy Zoo 1 data release
=========================

The original Galaxy Zoo project ran from July 2007 until February
2009, before being replaced by Galaxy Zoo 2 and then, in turn by
Galaxy Zoo: Hubble. Volunteers were asked to classify SDSS galaxies as
belonging to one of six categories - elliptical, clockwise spiral,
anticlockwise spiral, edge-on galaxies, 'star/don't know' or merger.

This webpage allows anyone to download the resulting classifications
of nearly 900,000 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

The project is described in Lintott et al., 2008, MNRAS, 389, 1179 and
the data release is described in a second paper. Anyone making use of
the data should cite at least one of these papers in any resulting
publications.

Table 2: GalaxyZoo1_DR_table2.csv
---------------------------------

Table 2 gives classifications of galaxies which have spectra included
in SDSS Data Release 7. The fraction of the vote in each of the six
categories is given, along with debiased votes in elliptical and
spiral categories and flags identifying systems as classified as
spiral, elliptical or uncertain.

Table 3: GalaxyZoo1_DR_table3.csv
---------------------------------

Table 3 gives classifications of galaxies included in the Galaxy Zoo
sample which did not have spectra available in SDSS Data Release 7. It
is not possible to estimate the bias in the sample, and so only the
fraction of the vote in each of the six categories is given.

Table 4: GalaxyZoo1_DR_table4.csv
---------------------------------

Table 4 gives a series of measures of classification confidence.

Table 5: GalaxyZoo1_DR_table5.csv.gz and Table 6: GalaxyZoo1_DR_table6.csv.gz
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tables 5 and 6 give the results from the bias study that introduced
mirrored (table 5) and monochrome (table 6) images.

Table 7: GalaxyZoo1_DR_table7.csv
---------------------------------

Table 7 gives the fraction of votes in each of the six categories,
combining results from the main and bias studies.
