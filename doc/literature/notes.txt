Discussed
.........

These are the papers we have discussed with our comments, in
chronological order.

* Moore, et al. "Mathematical Morphology: Star/Galaxy Differentiation
  & Galaxy Morphology Classification," Pub. Astr. Soc. Aus., 23(4),
  135--146 MPD06_

  + RJ: talks about separating galaxies from stars, as well as
    classifying the galaxies.

  + discussed 5/25/10

Scheduled for Discussion
........................

These are the papers we plan to discuss, in reverse chronological
order.

* Abraham, et al., "The Morphologies of Distant Galaxies.  I. An
  Automated Classification System", Ap. J. 432(75) AVY94_

  + to be discussed 6/1/10

Resources in this section are listed in alphabetical order of author.
Comments may be identified by the commenter's initials.

* Abraham, et al., "The Morphologies of Distant Galaxies.
  II. Classification from the Hubble Space Telescope Medium Deep
  Survey", Ap. J. Suppl. 107, 1--17 AVG96_

* Frei, "Semiâ€“Automatic Removal of Foreground Stars from Images of Galaxies"
  FRE96_

  + RJ: a bit dated, but seems like it might have some useful research
    that we can leverage.

* Ouzounis and Wilkinson, "Hyperconnected Attribute Filters Based on k-Flat Zones"
  OUW10_

  + RJ: interesting in that they are able to remove the stars and
    still keep the detail of the galaxy behind them.

  + RJ: The applications to historical documents are interesting to me
    as well.
