Scheduled for Discussion
........................

These are the papers we plan to discuss, in reverse chronological
order.

* Ball, et al., "Galaxy types in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using
  supervised artificial neural networks" BLK04_

  + RJ: The technique presented in this paper uses data collected from the
    Sloan Digitial Sky Survey as parameters to a neural net. Their approach
    isn't unique other than they are using a larger and higher quality
    dataset than those referenced in the paper. There is no machine vision
    component in their approach. One thing that we may be able to contribute
    here is to combine the visual inputs with the SDSS parameters to try
    to get a higher classification rate.

  + TB:  This study seems to implement the common approach of preliminary
    numerical decomposition using an array of historically preferred metrics.
    These metrics are not used in human visual recognition, and may not
    represent the optimal reduction of the data for neural clasification.
    The authors also seem to prefer reduced training time and network simplicity
    to accuracy.  This preference is a questionable goal for machine vision and
    learning, especially when a neural network trained by any algorithm can
    classify new suspects very quickly.  The use of a single output ANN is also
    strange considering a single ANN could provide the three output regression
    classes used in this study.

................................

Resources in this section are listed in alphabetical order of author.
Comments may be identified by the commenter's initials.

* Naim, et al., "Galaxy Morphology Without Classification: Self-organizing maps"
  AVI97_
  
  + TB: Discusses history of galaxy classification.  Suggests that the current
    historical segmentations are non-optimal and non-intiuitive, and have been
    over-refined.  Suggests application of an SOM to naturally create an
    intuitive mapping of galaxies into a 2 dimensional topology where adjacent
    map locations indicate feature commonality.

* Miller and Coe, "Star/galaxy classification using Kohonen
  self-organizing maps" MIL95_

  + TB: Applies SOM to binary segmentation between stars and galaxies.

Previously Discussed
....................

These are the papers we have discussed with our comments, in
chronological order.

* Moore, et al. "Mathematical Morphology: Star/Galaxy Differentiation
  & Galaxy Morphology Classification," Pub. Astr. Soc. Aus., 23(4),
  135--146 MPD06_

  + RJ: talks about separating galaxies from stars, as well as
    classifying the galaxies.

  + TB:  Differentiation relies on simple numerical descriptors in individual
    2 dimensional space.  Furthermore, the author uses linear seperation for
    classification.  It seems quite strange that the author uses a MLP Neural
    Network to calculate a linear seperator when a Neural Network specializes in
    non-linear seperation of classes.  Additionally, the author uses diamond
    shaped structuring elements for his morphological operations, which should
    produce undesired aliasing effects as these operators are not robust to
    rotation.  Overall, I find the classification approach here over simplistic.
    It may work well for galaxy/star differentiation, however, for galaxy type
    classification we can do better.

  + discussed 5/25/10

* Doi, et al. "Morphological classification of galaxies using simple
  photometric parameters" DOI93_

  + discussed 6/8/10

  + method strictly photometric, consistent with then-contemporary
    technology

* Frei, "Semiâ€“Automatic Removal of Foreground Stars from Images of Galaxies"
  FRE96_

  + RJ: a bit dated, but seems like it might have some useful research
    that we can leverage.

  + discussed 6/8/10

  + kinda ad-hoc, not automated

* Abraham, et al., "The Morphologies of Distant Galaxies.  I. An
  Automated Classification System", Ap. J. 432(75) AVY94_

  + discussed 6/1/10 - 6/22/10

  + BL: classifies using 2nd order moments and then looks for
    correlations in 2D plots (This may be a prelude to Tucker's
    suggestion of using Hu moments.)

* Abraham, et al., "The Morphologies of Distant Galaxies.
  II. Classification from the Hubble Space Telescope Medium Deep
  Survey", Ap. J. Suppl. 107, 1--17 AVG96_

  + The actual data from the previous paper.  Not discussed.

* Banerji, et al., "Galaxy Zoo: Reproducing Galaxy Morphologies Via
  Machine Learning" BAN10_

  + RJ: This is the paper related to the news article sent out by
    Dr. Lewis. We ought to see if the galaxy zoo people would be
    willing to collaborate and share data.

  + BL: They only use three categories, which are somewhat ill-defined.

  + BL: This seems to be a proof-of-concept paper.

  + web site: http://www.galaxyzoo.org

  + discussed on 6/15/10 and 6/22/10

* Ouzounis and Wilkinson, "Hyperconnected Attribute Filters Based on
  k-Flat Zones" OUW10_

  + RJ: interesting in that they are able to remove the stars and
    still keep the detail of the galaxy behind them.

  + RJ: The applications to historical documents are interesting to me
    as well. The author notes that this is the "most important" result
    of their research.

  + RJ: In this paper, they cluster flat zones (connected region with constant 
    brightness) based on intensity, rather than spacially. The 'k' in k-flat 
    simply refers to the limit of grey level variation to consider in the clustering.

  + discussed on 6/29/10
