Overview
........

These are notes on the readings for the Astronomical Computer Vision
Group at WSU Tri-Cities.

you can figure out from this example).

Discussed
.........

These are the papers we have discussed with our comments, in
chronological order.

* Moore, et al. "Mathematical Morphology: Star/Galaxy Differentiation
  & Galaxy Morphology Classification," Pub. Astr. Soc. Aus., 23(4),
  135--146 MPD06_

  + RJ: talks about separating galaxies from stars, as well as
    classifying the galaxies.

  + TB:  Differentiation relies on simple numerical descriptors in individual
    2 dimensional space.  Furthermore, the author uses linear seperation for
    classification.  It seems quite strange that the author uses a MLP Neural
    Network to calculate a linear seperator when a Neural Network specializes in
    non-linear seperation of classes.  Additionally, the author uses diamond
    shaped structuring elements for his morphological operations, which should
    produce undesired aliasing effects as these operators are not robust to
    rotation.  Overall, I find the classification approach here over simplistic.
    It may work well for galaxy/star differentiation, however, for galaxy type
    classification we can do better.

Scheduled for Discussion
........................

These are the papers we plan to discuss, in reverse chronological
order.

* Abraham, et al., "The Morphologies of Distant Galaxies.  I. An
  Automated Classification System", Ap. J. 432(75) AVY94_

  + to be discussed 6/1/10

Resources in this section are listed in alphabetical order of author.
Comments may be identified by the commenter's initials.

* Abraham, et al., "The Morphologies of Distant Galaxies.
  II. Classification from the Hubble Space Telescope Medium Deep
  Survey", Ap. J. Suppl. 107, 1--17 AVG96_

* Frei, "Semiâ€“Automatic Removal of Foreground Stars from Images of Galaxies"
  FRE96_

  + RJ: a bit dated, but seems like it might have some useful research
    that we can leverage.

* Ouzounis and Wilkinson, "Hyperconnected Attribute Filters Based on k-Flat Zones"
  OUW10_

  + RJ: interesting in that they are able to remove the stars and
    still keep the detail of the galaxy behind them.

  + RJ: The applications to historical documents are interesting to me
    as well.

* Banerji, et al., "Galaxy Zoo: Reproducing Galaxy Morphologies Via Machine Learning"
  BAN10_

  + RJ: This is the paper related to the news article sent out by Dr. Lewis. We ought to
    see if the galaxy zoo people would be willing to collaborate and share data.
