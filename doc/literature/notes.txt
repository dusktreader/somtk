Resources in this section are listed in alphabetical order of author.
Comments may be identified by the commenter's initials.

* Frei, "Semiâ€“Automatic Removal of Foreground Stars from Images of Galaxies"
  FRE96_

  + RJ: a bit dated, but seems like it might have some useful research
    that we can leverage.

* Ouzounis and Wilkinson, "Hyperconnected Attribute Filters Based on k-Flat Zones"
  OUW10_

  + RJ: interesting in that they are able to remove the stars and
    still keep the detail of the galaxy behind them.

  + RJ: The applications to historical documents are interesting to me
    as well.

* Moore, et al. "Mathematical Morphology: Star/Galaxy Differentiation
  & Galaxy Morphology Classification" MPD06_

  + RJ: talks about separating galaxies from stars, as well as
    classifying the galaxies.
