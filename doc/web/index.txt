Here is some very preliminary work on using computer vision techniques
for galaxy detection.

1. We've started with an arbitrary cluster image.  The web site
   (HS04site_) is effusive about the ~10,000 galaxies in this image
   (although no reference is given about what the name of the cluster
   is).  In any case, it's a pretty honkin' big cluster.

   We've attached screen dumps that show our software in operation on
   the original 6200 x 6200 pixel image (HS04_).  Here is a section of
   that image:

2. And here's what Tucker's "finder" program detected.  He used a
   multi-level "top hat" filter.  This is a pretty well-known
   non-linear filter.  (The "multi-level" is why the rectangles are of
   various sizes.)

   Use "Ctrl+" and "Ctrl-" to zoom in and out.

   Notes and Observations:

   * As the screen dump says, we detected 1612 objects.  (That's in
     the whole original image.)

   * It's clear that a lot of smaller galaxies were missed.

   * Some larger edge-on spirals were missed.  We have some ideas
     about adapting the detector for them.

   * Of course, we detect foreground stars as well as galaxies.  We
     might be able to build a filter to distinguish stellar
     diffraction disks (even with spikes) from real galaxies.

   * We think we can detect galactic centers and distinguish them from
     spiral arms.  This could help isolate overlapping galaxies.

   * The process required less than a minute of CPU time.

   There's certainly more work to do.

   Beyond detection, we will also be working on automated
   classification schemes.
